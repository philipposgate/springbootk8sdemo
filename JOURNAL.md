# Developer's Journal

## October 15, 2022 - Philip Posgate

Ok, it's been a long time since I last created a project on GitHub.  This will be another example of SpringBoot API, but this time with Docker and Kubernetes.  I am doing this with the recent experience I've gained as an engineer at SunLife, but with the standard practice that is described by the article at https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-kubernetes/.

I started with a project generated at https://start.spring.io/ with just **web** and **actuator** dependencies.  I download this to my local, do the usual **git init** thing, and push it up to https://github.com/philipposgate/springbootk8sdemo.

Then I added this JOURNAL.md file to the project.  I intend to make journal entries as I go.
